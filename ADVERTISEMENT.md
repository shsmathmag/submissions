Are you interested in math or science research? We are now accepting submissions for the 5th edition of The Eagle's √−1, the Sharon High School math magazine!

You can write about anything math-related! This includes traditional mathematics subjects (including geometry, algebra, graph theory, number theory, and calculus), but can also include applied mathematics and mathematics-adjacent topics, such as computer science, math history, and physics, just to name a few.
