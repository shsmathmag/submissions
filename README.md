# Submitting an Article

## General Guidelines

If you are familiar with LaTeX typesetting, please do us a favor and write your article in LaTeX. *If you choose this option, please also see our [LaTeX Guidelines](LATEX.md) to make the process of adding your article easier for us.*

Beginning with the 5th edition, The Eagle's √−1 will be open to **anything STEM-related**, not just mathematics. Possible topics include physics, chemistry, biology, number theory, geometry, robotics, and programming. We will also accept expository articles on STEM history or famous scientists and mathematicians. If you want to get a sense of what to write about, feel free to take a look at [last year's edition](https://github.com/shsmathmag/2025).

## Formatting

Please keep the title of your article to fewer than 60 characters. Fewer than 50 is preferred. If your title is too long, we will modify it.

When it comes to diagrams, please remember that the physical copies of the magazine will be printed in **black and white**. The diagrams will be resized to a width of 8 centimeters *at maximum*. Please make sure that all text (such as labels or captions) is legible.

All diagrams that you include (`.jpg`, `.png`, and any other media files) *must* be submitted along with your article. The submission form will include instructions for the platform you choose to submit on. Please title all such files with your last name. For example, the second diagram in Aiden Liang's article would be titled `liang_2.png`.
